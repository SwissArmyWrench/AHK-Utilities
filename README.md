# AHK-Utilities

AutoHotKey is a very powerful tool that adds scripting and automation capabilities to Windows. However, this power can only be properly harnessed through writing, testing, and fixing code. Many users who are not programmers would still greatly benefit from the capabilties of AutoHotKey, so I host a collection of my personal utilities here on to make them available to others.

AutoHotKey can be installed at https://www.autohotkey.com/. All code uploaded here is designed for AutoHotKey 2.0.
